# FACE-RECOGNITION
This project aims to develop a face recognition system using machine learning algorithms. Face recognition is a computer application that is capable of detecting, tracking, identifying or verifying human faces from an image or video captured using a digital camera.The system can handle real-time attendance data and can be integrated with
existing attendance management systems.
                         Here in this project, I have used different classifiers such as KNN, Decision
Tree, Na√Øve bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine(SVM) ,Logistic Regression,
Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA).
